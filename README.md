# Outside-In-TDD
Outside-In TDD slidedeck and code from Leeds Sharp (31st May 2018)

Inside the solution Files folder there are three files:

- **Requirements** 
explains the task
- **Account** is the starting point (Do not change the signature of any of the methods).
- **Feature** is my initial acceptance test which will have more setup code as you discover and add collaborating classes.
